# Factors affecting the development

(user-needs)=
## User Needs

The first stage of the Software Development Cycle is “Analyse detailed
requirements”. During this phase the software developer communicates with the
client and potential users of the software. Data collect methods such as
surveys, observation and interviews can be used to ascertain user needs. The
more complex the user needs to longer a project will take and/or the more
resources it will require (eg.coders).

(user-interface)=
## User Interface
The means by which the user and a computer system interact using input devices
and software. The type of user interface required, and its technical
specifications will affect the types of resources required (financial, coders
expertise). For example, if a user interface such as an app has user generated
content, code will need to be written to communicate with a live database.

Now that we have many different devices, we need customised interfaces for large
screens like TVs, computer screens, phone screens and even watches.

Web accessibility
: websites, tools, and technologies are designed and developed so that people with disabilities can use them.

We can make user interfaces more accessible by including:
* Audio descriptions
* Auditory, tactile, and visual notifications
* Braille
* Captions
* Text-to-speech
* Transcripts

(processing-efficiency)=
## Processing efficiency
Refers to how effective the software is at processing data to achieve its desired purpose. If code is not written well it can result in longer processing time when dealing with large amount of data and/or requests.
eg sorting algorithms (sort data into order)

It would be unwise to run 'high end' software on 'low end' hardware as it will crash. 
When making software, it must be designed to match particular hardware. 

These are listed in the technical specifications when purchasing the software.


```{admonition} Think-Pair-Share
In pairs:
1. Discuss situations where efficiency of software is important to you.
1. Find a webpage that discusses poorly performing software
1. Record a description and a link in your notes.
```


(development-time)=
## Development time
Development time constraints will affect the development of software. If
software needs to be deployed quickly then either more resources need to
allocated to the project (eg.coders, software engineers) or functionality will
be compromised.

Questions to be considered include:
* How much time is needed?
* How many programmers are working on the project?
* How much time will be used for coordination?
* How much time will be used for testing?

Testing must be in this development time to ensure that the software works as intended.


(tech-specs)=
## Technical Specifications

Technical specifications refer to the functionality of software and the
expertise that is required to design/code the solution. The higher the technical
requirements, the higher coding expertise required. This will result in a higher
cost for the software.

It is important to match the software to the hardware.
If software is made that demands 8 Gb of RAM and it is on a computer that has
only 2 Gb of RAM, there will be problems.

This is called hardware/software compatibility.
When advertising the software, the technical specifications must be listed.
