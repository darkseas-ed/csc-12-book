# Software Development - Licence Agreements

Software licenses are legal agreements between the owner or distributor of a
software product and the end user. They outline the terms and conditions under
which the software can be used, distributed, modified, and accessed. Software
licenses grant users certain rights and impose certain restrictions on the use
of the software.

License agreement
: is the right to use software.

That is, you do not own the software. The most common type of license included
with software purchased by individual users is a single-user license agreement,
also called an end-user license agreement (EULA). The license agreement provides
specific conditions for use Of the software, which a user must accept before
using the software. These terms usually are displayed when you install the
software.

(network-licenses)=
## Network Licenses

Software allocated to a business/company on number of licenses purchased. A school purchases a 50 seat license. After 50 students have started the software it will work, but for the 51st student, it won't work. When the students log off, it frees up so others can use that licence.

(Enterprise)=
## Enterprise
Software purchased by a large organisation for every one in the organisation to use. A government department purchases an enterprise license for Adobe Photoshop for every one in the department to use.

(commercial-proprietary)=
## Commercial/Proprietary

Software made by a company to make a profit. Â It is closed source so no one can copy the original coding. Examples are Adobe CC and Logic Pro and many others
We pay for it, it usually has support and regular updates.

(eula)=
## EULA

An agreement that must be agreed to when installing proprietary software. We must tick the box to accept the terms and conditions for using the software. So the end user (you) agrees to use the software in the way that the makers of the software want us to.
