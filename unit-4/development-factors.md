# Factors affecting the development of software

(user-needs)=
## User Needs

The first stage of the Software Development Cycle is “Analyse detailed
requirements”. During this phase the software developer communicates with the
client and potential users of the software. Data collect methods such as
surveys, observation and interviews can be used to ascertain user needs. The
more complex the user needs to longer a project will take and/or the more
resources it will require (eg.coders).

(user-interface)=
## User Interface
The means by which the user and a computer system interact using input devices
and software. The type of user interface required, and its technical
specifications will affect the types of resources required (financial, coders
expertise). For example, if a user interface such as an app has user generated
content, code will need to be written to communicate with a live database.

(processing-efficiency)=
## Processing efficiency
Refers to how effective the software is at processing data to achieve its desired purpose. If code is not written well it can result in longer processing time when dealing with large amount of data and/or requests.
eg sorting algorithms (sort data into order)

(development-time)=
## Development time
Development time constraints will affect the development of software. If
software needs to be deployed quickly then either more resources need to
allocated to the project (eg.coders, software engineers) or functionality will
be compromised.

(tech-specs)=
## Technical Specifications

Technical specifications refer to the functionality of software and the
expertise that is required to design/code the solution. The higher the technical
requirements, the higher coding expertise required. This will result in a higher
cost for the software.
